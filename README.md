# Development of Polypropylene Composites Using Treated Date Palm Fibers as Filler

## Project Overview
This project investigates the potential of using treated date palm fibers as a reinforcement material in polypropylene composites. The primary objective is to develop a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional composite materials.

### Research Goals
* **Fiber Treatment:** Develop an efficient process for treating date palm fibers to improve their compatibility with the polypropylene matrix and enhance the overall properties of the composite.
* **Composite Manufacturing:** Investigate the feasibility of producing polypropylene composites with high percentages of date palm fibers using 15-ton hydraulic press.
* **Mechanical Characterization:** Evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites, focusing on bending strength and modulus of elasticity.
* **Optimization:** Determine the optimal fiber loading to achieve a balance between cost, sustainability, and mechanical performance.

### Key Findings
* **Fiber Treatment:** A successful process was developed to treat and process date palm fibers.
* **Composite Manufacturing:** Composites with up to 60% fiber loading were successfully produced.
* **Mechanical Testing:** The optimal fiber loading for maintaining bending strength was found to be 20%.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Higher fiber loadings offer significant cost advantages due to the lower cost of natural fibers compared to polypropylene.
